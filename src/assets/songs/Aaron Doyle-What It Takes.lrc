[00:19.77]Everyone talks about what they think they need
[00:22.14]They make up a list of things: 1, 2, 3...
[00:24.58]Everyone is different but where we can agree
[00:26.83]Is every girl wants her boy to treat her sweet

[00:29.27]Don't think that being mean will get you anywhere
[00:31.58]Don't think that acting cool will make me want to care
[00:33.96]I just need your respect, if you're gonna be the one
[00:36.27]And if you must apply then try to get the job done

[01:00.10]Be good to me
[01:01.23]If you want my attraction
[01:02.47]Maybe I just want too much
[01:03.79]But I don't really care
[01:04.91]I know I'm worth it
[01:05.91]And I know he's out there

[01:07.23]Wait, wait
[01:08.54]You might be a contender
[01:09.73]Hey, hey,
[01:10.73]Can I borrow your sweatshirt

[01:12.04]Normally I'm not the one
[01:13.23]To say hello first
[01:14.23]But if I didn't I might miss out
[01:15.29]And that might hurt

[01:35.63]I've been contemplating
[01:38.13]What it takes
[01:39.82]To make me give my heart
[01:43.07]Could you be the one, standing
[01:46.88]In the crowd
[01:48.67]I'm waiting to find out
[01:52.16]I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
