[01:01.45]this is how the story goes ,in and out
[01:03.35]one minute u're there, the next time runs out
[01:05.85]its a figure of speech as a matter of fact
[01:08.46]did u ever really think about the time you had
[01:10.90]its the grain that falls, every second that crawls
[01:13.28]to the minute to the hour till infinity recalls
[01:16.14]its a barricade of twigs thats really never there
[01:19.33]did u ever really think that time even cares
[01:21.16]ik ehsaas hai
[01:23.61]keh socha na tha
[01:26.16]waqt dhalta raha

[02:24.67]the time that got left and time that ran out
