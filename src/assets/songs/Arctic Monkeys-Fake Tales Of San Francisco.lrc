Fake Tales of San Francisco



Echo through the room



More point to a wedding disco



Without a bride or groom 



There's a super cool band yeah



With their trilbys and their glasses of white wine



And all the weekend rockstars in the toilets



Practicing their lines 





I don't want to hear you



(Kick me out, kick me out)



I don't want to hear, you know



(Kick me out, kick me out)



I don't want to hear you



(Kick me out, kick me out)



I don't want to hear you



I don't want to hear your... 





Fake Tales of San Fransisco



Echo through the air



And there's a few bored faces in the back



All wishing they weren't there 





And as the microphone squeaks



A young girl's telephone beeps



Yeah she's dashing for the exit



And she's running to the streets outside



"Oh you've saved me," she screams down the line



"The band aren't very good



And I'm not having a nice time" 





I don't want to hear you



(Kick me out, kick me out)



I don't want to hear, you know



(Kick me out, kick me out) 





Yeah but his bird thinks it's amazing, though



So all that's left



Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf 





He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar



I don't quite know the distance



But I'm sure that's far



Yeah I'm sure that's pretty far 





And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem



You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham



So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook



Yeah, yeah, yeah 





Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook



Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook



Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook



Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook



Yeah
