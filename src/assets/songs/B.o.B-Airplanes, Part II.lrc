[03:16.20]Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
[03:18.45]Let's pretend things would've been no different
[03:20.89]Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
[03:23.57]Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper-thin
[03:26.01]They could blow 'way with the wind
[03:27.38]Marshall, you're never gonna make it
[03:28.88]Makes no sense to play the game, ain't no way that you'll win
[03:31.38]Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
[03:33.80]Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
[03:36.55]And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
[03:39.06]He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
[03:41.62]He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
[03:44.22]And he never dreamed that he could rip stadiums
[03:46.60]And just lazy as shit
[03:47.83]Fuck a talent show in a gymnasium, bitch
[03:50.20]You won't amount to shit, quit daydreamin', kid
[03:52.68]You need to get your cranium checked
[03:54.09]You're thinkin' like an alien, it just ain't realistic
[03:56.84]Now pretend that they ain't just make him angry with this shit
[03:59.97]And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
[04:02.46]And his alarm went off to wake him
[04:03.97]But he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
[04:05.92]Slept through his plane and he missed it
[04:07.72]He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Laney
[04:10.50]These food stamps and this WIC shit
[04:12.22]'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
[04:14.63]But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here
[04:16.92]He pretends that

[04:18.07]Airplanes
[04:19.14]In the night sky
[04:20.30]Are like shooting stars?
[04:22.06]I could really use a wish right now
