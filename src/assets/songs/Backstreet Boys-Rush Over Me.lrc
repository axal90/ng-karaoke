[00:11.93]You washed away my sad face
[00:18.16]And flooded all my empty space
[00:24.27]You take away life's heartbreak
[00:29.50]And I know with you it's gonna be okay
[00:34.06]You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)
[00:39.50]I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)
[00:45.64]And now I feel so alive (now i'm into something, something real)
[00:49.89]So alive (you're the air in my atmosphere)
[00:53.96]Finally I feel complete
