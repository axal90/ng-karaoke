[00:12.16]It's kinda funny how life can change
[00:17.17]Can flip 180 in a matter of days
[00:22.30]Sometimes love works in mysterious ways
[00:27.31]One day you wake up gone without a trace

[00:53.17]One love - for the mother's pride
[00:55.79]One love - for the times we cried
[00:58.18]One love - gotta stay alive
[01:02.17]I will survive
[01:03.37]One love - for the city streets

[01:08.44]One love, Oh I do believe
[01:11.47]One love is all we need
[01:13.92]
[01:18.16]Late at night I'm still wide awake
[01:23.11]Feel this is far more than I can take
[01:27.94]I thought my heart could never break
[01:33.27]Now I know that's one big mistake
