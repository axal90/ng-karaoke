[00:17.06]Oh her eyes, her eyes
[00:19.31]Make the stars look like
[00:20.56]They're not shining
[00:22.06]Her hair, her hair
[00:23.68]Falls perfectly
[00:24.74]Without her trying
[00:26.63]She's so beautiful
[00:29.30]And I tell her every day
[00:32.18]
[00:34.18]Yeah, I know, I know
[00:36.93]When I compliment her
[00:38.18]She won't believe me
[00:39.63]And it's so, it's so
[00:41.31]Sad to think that
[00:42.23]She don't see what I see
[00:44.23]But every time she asks me
[00:45.93]Do I look okay?

[00:49.43]
[00:51.01]When I see your face
[00:53.55]

[00:57.30]That I would change

[01:21.00]Just the way you are
[01:24.44]
[01:28.07]Her lips, her lips
[01:29.87]I could kiss them all day
[01:31.12]If she'd let me
[01:32.43]Her laugh, her laugh
[01:34.39]She hates but I think
[01:35.39]It's so sexy
[01:37.13]She's so beautiful
[01:39.68]And I tell her every day
[01:43.25]

[01:51.82]Then just stay the same
[01:53.90]So
