[00:13.44]Baby, baby with your skin so fair, my heart shoots up straight in the air
[00:24.44]When you hold my hand, when you free my mind
[00:30.51]But just make sure you're not wastin' time, wastin' time
[00:41.76]

[02:01.43]So please don't hate me, no, please don't mind
[02:07.30]Cause I just need to start wastin' time
[02:14.01]Time, time, time, time
[02:18.76]
[02:19.76]Something please come along and rescue me I need to run away
