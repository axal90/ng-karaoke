[00:34.00]
[00:35.50]Lead to the river
[00:38.30]Midsummer, I waved
[00:41.20]A "V" of black swans
[00:43.50]On with hope to the grave
[00:47.20]All through Red September
[00:50.20]With skies fire-paved
[00:53.00]I begged you appear
[00:55.20]Like a thorn for the holy ones
[00:58.30]
[00:58.50]Cold was my soul
[01:01.30]Untold was the pain
[01:04.30]I faced when you left me
[01:07.30]A rose in the rain
[01:10.00]So I swore to the razor
[01:13.00]That never, enchained
[01:15.40]Would your dark nails of faith
[01:18.70]Be pushed through my veins again
[01:21.90]
[01:22.10]Bared on your tomb
[01:24.70]I'm a prayer for your loneliness
[01:28.20]And would you ever soon
[01:30.30]Come above unto me?
[01:33.30]For once upon a time
[01:36.00]From the binds of your lowliness
[01:39.80]I could always find
[01:42.00]The right slot for your sacred key
[01:46.00]
[01:46.20]Six feet deep is the incision
[01:48.90]In my heart, that barless prison
[01:51.50]Discolours all with tunnel vision
[01:54.50]Sunsetter
[01:56.00]Nymphetamine
[01:57.70]Sick and weak from my condition
[02:00.30]This lust, is vampyric addiction
[02:03.00]To her alone in full submission
[02:06.00]None better
[02:07.60]Nymphetamine
[02:12.60]
[02:12.80]Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
[02:18.80]Nymphetamine girl
[02:24.80]Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
[02:30.20]My nymphetamine girl
[02:34.00]
[02:34.00]Wracked with your charm
[02:35.70]I am circled like prey
[02:37.00]Back in the forest
[02:38.00]Where whispers persuade
[02:39.20]More sugar trails
[02:40.40]More white lady laid
[02:41.80]Than pillars of salt
[02:44.90]
[02:45.10]Fold to my arms
[02:47.20]Hold their mesmeric sway
[02:51.00]And dance her to the moon
[02:53.00]As we did in those golden days
[02:56.80]
[02:57.00]Christening stars
[02:59.80]I remember the way
[03:02.00]We were needle and spoon
[03:05.20]Mislaid in the burning hay
[03:08.60]
[03:08.80]Bared on your tomb
[03:10.80]I'm a prayer for your loneliness
[03:13.80]And would you ever soon
[03:16.00]Come above unto me?
[03:19.50]For once upon a time
[03:22.30]From the bind of your lowliness
[03:26.20]I could always find
[03:28.40]The right slot for your sacred key
[03:32.30]
[03:32.50]Six feet deep is the incision
[03:35.40]In my heart, that barless prison
[03:38.10]Discolours all with tunnel vision
[03:41.30]Sunsetter
[03:42.40]Nymphetamine
[03:44.20]Sick and weak from my condition
[03:46.80]This lust, is vampyric addiction
[03:49.80]To her alone in full submission
[03:52.80]None better
[03:53.80]Nymphetamine
[04:03.80]
[04:04.00]Sunsetter
[04:06.00]Nymphetamine (Nymphetamine)
[04:16.30]None better
[04:17.50]Nymphetamine
[04:23.00]
[04:23.20]Nymphetamine, Nymphetamine
[04:28.60]Nymphetamine girl
[04:34.20]Nymphetamine, Nymphetamine
[04:39.40]My nymphetamine girl
