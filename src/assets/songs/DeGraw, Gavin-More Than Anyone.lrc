You need a friend

I'll be around

Don't let this end

before I see you again

What can I say to convince you to change your mind?..Don't leave


I'm gonna love you more than anyone

I'm gonna hold you closer than before

And when I kiss your soul, your body be free, I'll be free for you anytime

I'm gonna love you more than anyone


Look in my eyes

What do you see

Not just the color

Look inside of me

Tell me your need and I will try

I will try


I'm gonna love you more than anyone

I'm gonna hold you closer than before

And when I kiss your soul, your body be free, I'll be free for you anytime

I'm gonna love you more than anyone


Free for you whenever you need

We'll be free together baby, free together baby
