[00:01.46][Intro]

[00:01.78]Shady, we're back

[00:03.15][Verse 1 - Eminem]

[00:03.53]Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
[00:05.71]you better just make new living arrangements,
[00:07.78]if you think your the top and king of the castle
[00:10.34]You about to get thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
[00:13.53]All I hear is, I'm best at this an I'm best at that,
[00:15.84]but I don't hear my name No man brought up in rap
[00:18.46]and I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
[00:21.03]but when they say one of the best, im nowhere thought of as that
[00:23.71]Not even the same league as Jay-Z
[00:25.84]Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe they'll name me
[00:28.46]Somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ
[00:31.03]or say "he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay-Z
[00:33.78]Yo, his verses were crazy on that Renegade beat
[00:36.53]but I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
[00:39.15]And I all I hear is pop tunes come on the rad-i-o
[00:42.09]And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily"
[00:44.28]And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
[00:47.53]when they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
[00:50.21]Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
[00:52.59]and make it big-big-big-big-b-baby

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]

[00:55.65]So maybe the 80's made me crazy, I been tryin' to get my weight
[00:59.03]up since the A Slim Shady gave me the gate key, paid the ways
[01:02.90]So lately mind state's get better each day, replay my relay race
[01:07.84]when I was chasin' the a fey at 18, 8 years later his voice in Beijing
[01:12.03]no choice I chase cream so..
