[00:59.59]You probably shocked, probably ready to stop this already
[01:02.47]You probably can't hang with the way we attack it so steady

[01:17.20]Get up, get up, get up, get up
[01:20.26]Get up, get up, get up, get up
[01:23.37]Wait a second you know the program this is not a slow jam
[01:25.00]
[01:26.48]This is not a love song unless you love tearing shit down
[01:30.15]Take a look around you're not running this
[01:32.66]The bluff in your nothing will hit you like a ton of bricks
[01:35.63]Hit you together with pressure you can never stand
[01:38.65]The softest leather just a featherweight whatever man
[01:41.62]We're not your competitors setting you straight
[01:44.13]You never compete forget it it's already too late, go!

[02:12.64]Give me a second I'm collecting my thoughts
[02:14.18]And setting plots
[02:15.20]All right y'all ready or not?!
[02:17.10]I've listened and watched and waited for an opening spot
[02:19.98]And now that I got it nobody can pay me to stop
[02:23.09]I'm sick of that same thing I've been forced to hear
[02:25.00]
[02:26.07]Over and over again let me make this clear
[02:28.90]If anybody pretends that we're nothing to fear
[02:31.87]I solemnly swear it's over
[02:33.82]You can tell 'em we're here
[02:35.45]This is the time so just follow me
[02:38.28]It's already heated to 100 degrees so
[02:41.34]Get up, get up, get up, get up
[02:44.00]Get up, get up, get up, get up
[02:47.29]Yo if you don't see I'm a make you see this
