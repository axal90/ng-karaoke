[00:19]There's a woman crying out tonight
[00:22]Her world has changed
[00:24]She asks God why
[00:25]Her only son has died
[00:29]And now her daughter cries
[00:31]She can't sleep at night

[00:35]Downtown
[00:37]Another day for all the suits and ties
[00:40]Another war to fight
[00:42]There's no regard for life
[00:44]How do they sleep at night
[00:46]How can we make things right?
[00:49]Just wanna make this right

[01:14]We are all the same
[01:20]Human in all our ways and all of pain
[01:29](So let it be)
[01:31]There's a love that could fall down like rain
[01:34](Let us see)
[01:35]Let forgiveness wash away the pain
[01:38](What we need)
[01:39]And no one really knows what they are searching for
[01:43](We believe)
[01:44]This world is crying for so much more

[02:11]We believe
[02:13]We believe
[02:15]We believe
[02:17]We believe
[02:19]In This Love

[02:42]So this world
[02:44]Is too much
[02:46]For you to take
[02:48]Just lay it down and follow me
[02:53]I'll be everything you need
[02:58]In every way

[03:03]We believe
