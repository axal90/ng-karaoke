[00:39.95]Trapped within your own apathy.
[00:42.65]Spiralling into a cycle of loss.
[00:45.51]Beaten mind with a bruised reflection.
[00:48.34]It's addiction to failure and substances.
[00:51.03]That ties you to your selfish punishment.
[00:54.26]In your eyes it's cursed.
[00:57.09]No fix, no cure, tortured with imperfection.
[01:01.62]Your hatred is aimless.
[01:03.90]This is my hatred, this is my vow.
[01:06.90]Never to be broken.
