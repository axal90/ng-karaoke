[00:12.59]It's calming down outside
[00:15.34]Another lonely night
[00:18.13]Said you were just going out with your friends
[00:23.81]I'm waiting up this time
[00:26.84]I hope you didn't lie
[00:30.06]It never used to be like this way back when
[00:35.02]I never know where you're at
[00:38.66]Another train off the tracks
[00:41.46]And I don't want to live like that
[00:43.91]No, Ohhh...
[00:47.85]When you walked in so damn late
[00:50.78]What the hell was I supposed to think?
[00:53.85]When you've had too much to drink
[00:56.51]And you're really looking guilty, ohhh...
[00:59.40]When you wouldn't even look at me
[01:02.29]There was only one thing it could be
[01:05.08]You were with him all this time
[01:08.21]Here’s one last kiss goodbye
[01:11.02]
[01:15.91]No more alibis
[01:19.02]No more inner lies
[01:21.71]You’ve broken my trust and it can’t be fixed
[01:27.29]I should’ve seen the signs
[01:30.88]Should’ve recognized
[01:33.53]The way your lips looked like they’ve been kissed
[01:38.96]How did we end up like this?
[01:42.34]Another train off the tracks
[01:45.29]It always hurts looking back now
[01:48.75]Ohhh...
[01:51.38]When you walked in so damn late
[01:54.26]What the hell was I supposed to think?
[01:57.26]When you've had too much to drink

[02:02.97]When you wouldn't even look at me
[02:05.87]There was only one thing it could be
[02:08.97]You were with him all this time
[02:11.77]Here’s one last kiss goodbye
[02:14.35]Another lesson learned in life, ohhh...
[02:20.39]And I can ask and listen why...
[02:27.20]
[02:37.53]How did we end up like that?
