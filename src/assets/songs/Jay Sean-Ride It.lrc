[00:30.06](Let me feel you)
[00:31.62]It's been about a month and twenty days...
[00:35.86]And were going round and round playing silly games...
[00:37.41]Now your saying, slow it down, not right now..Then you wink at me and walk away..
[00:39.53]Now, let it be, let it be, let it be known...
[00:41.52]Oh no, don't go...
[00:46.99]Touching and teasing me, telling me no...
[00:50.05]But this time I need to feel you....
[00:52.03]
[Chorus:]
[00:53.96](Ride it) were all alone...
[00:55.40](Ride it) just loose control...
[00:57.32](Ride it, ride it) touch my soul...
[00:59.82](Ride it, ride it) let me feel you...
[01:02.61](Ride it) turn the lights down low...
[01:05.35](Ride it) from head to toe...
