[00:31.90]Boy you aint impressin' me 
[00:33.43]With your jewelry, your designer clothes 
[00:35.36]Or the games that you try to play 
[00:37.07]Think you need to know, I got my own 
[00:39.69]Dont need you for your dough 
[00:41.19]Hearin' me, maybe then we can flow, let me know 
[00:43.96]Make me smile, maybe we can chill 
[00:46.68]Keep it real, show me something I can feel 
[00:49.30]Cause I'm not your average ordinary type 
[00:52.45]Could you be that kinda guy I like?
