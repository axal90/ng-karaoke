[00:14.36]I've said it once and I'll say it again.
[00:20.35]I've got something hanging over my head.
[00:26.10]I was laying on your shoulder
[00:29.59]Perfectly content.
[00:32.59]Until you told me all over again.
[00:37.58]
[00:38.72]I aint got no sob story to write.
[00:44.72]But just like everyone else I'm living this life.
[00:49.72]And you don't need to win me over.
[00:53.27]And there aint no other side.
[00:56.46]To shuffle me from.
[00:58.08]I belong where I decide.
[01:01.76]But you say...
[01:03.01]
[01:03.32]We don't mess around.

[01:45.99]That I'm the whisper conscience in your ear.
[01:50.79]Yeah, and that's exactly the reason that I'll never fit in here
[01:58.41]Well nothing's ever that blackand white, my dear.
[02:03.40]Cuz you say...

[02:32.36]I'm not your angel darling.
[02:35.17]I am never gonna be.
[02:41.54]I'm not your angel darling.
