[00:08.60]Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
[00:12.45]Drifting throught the wind

[00:16.36]Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
[00:20.09]Like a house of cards
[00:22.13]One blow from caving in
[00:23.61]
[00:24.18]Do you ever feel already buried deep
[00:27.73]Six feet under scream

[01:33.38]If you only knew what the future holds
[01:37.10]After a hurricane comes a rainbow
[01:40.76]
[01:41.14]Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
[01:44.80]So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
[01:48.65]Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
[01:52.57]And when it's time, you'll know
[01:55.54]
[01:55.80]You just gotta ignite the light
[01:59.33]And let it shine
