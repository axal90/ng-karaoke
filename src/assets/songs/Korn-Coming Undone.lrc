[00:24.52]Sing along mocking bird
[00:27.46]You don't affect me

[01:18.52]I thought my demons were my friends
[01:22.15]Getting me in the end
[01:25.09]They're out to get me
[01:29.09]Since I was young
[01:31.40]I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
[01:34.77]And this sweet chugga gun
[01:37.90]Does not protect me
