The human condition is inherit claustrophobia.
Compression of my space made complete.
I would rip out my own entrails by hand just to be alone.
Inanity rolls total through this sphere. 
Ostracized for clarity of vision. 
A dream unrealized of solitudethat i should decend into autonomy
& know the pain of fellowship no more. I feel nothing but a lack of space.
Paradox of socialization results in duress.
Rife with hostility, what has caused me so much hate?
Humanity. Exterminate with extreme predjudice.
