[00:23.77]Everytime that I'm where you are 
[02:53.29][00:29.54]You walk in and my strength walks out the door 
[02:58.38][00:34.55]Say my name and I can't fight it anymore

[01:29.97]They say you're something I should do without 
[01:35.06]They don't know what goes on 
[01:37.67]When the lights go out
