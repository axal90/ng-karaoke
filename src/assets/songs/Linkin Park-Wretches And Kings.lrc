[00:41.05]To save face
[00:42.24]How low can you go
[00:43.87]Talk a lot of game but yet you don’t know
[00:46.74]Static on the way make us all say whoa
[00:49.42]The people up top push the people down low
[00:51.85]Get down and obey every word
[00:54.47]Steady get in line if you haven’t yet heard
[00:57.09]Want to take what I got don’t be absurd
[00:59.46]Don’t fight the power and nobody gets hurt
[01:02.22]If you haven’t heard yet than I’m letting you know
[01:04.92]There ain’t shit we don’t run when guns unload
[01:07.55]And no one make a move unless my people say so
[01:10.41]Got everything under control
[01:12.05]Now everybody go
[01:15.75]

[01:35.48]How slow can you go
[01:37.34]Talk a lot of shit and yet you don’t know
[01:39.77]Fire on the way make you all say whoa
[01:42.39]The people up top and the people down low
[01:44.89]Get down and I’m running it like that
[01:47.89]The front of the attack is exactly where I’m at
[01:50.56]Somewhere in between and kicking the hi-hat
[01:53.25]The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
[01:55.74]So get with the combat
[01:57.31]I’m letting them know
[01:58.49]There ain’t shit you can say to make me back down low
[02:00.92]So push the button and the whole thing blows
[02:03.73]Spinning everything out of control
[02:05.54]Now everybody go
