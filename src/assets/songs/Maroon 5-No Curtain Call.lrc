[00:06.49]You say you need someone
[00:08.98]But everybody does
[00:12.09]I'm no different than you
[00:15.18]I just believe what I do

[00:17.99]You point your finger at
[00:20.78]Everyone but yourself
[00:23.69]And blame the ones that you love

[01:09.69]No curtain call,just take it all
[01:14.99]
[01:17.99]I have no time for fear
[01:20.19]Or people in my ear
[01:23.59]Head down and running so fast
[01:26.60]Try not to dwell on the past

[01:29.50]I'm fighting through this pain
[01:31.99]And things I cannot change
[01:35.30]Running right into the flame
[01:38.07]Rather than running away

[02:21.07]No curtain call,just take it all
