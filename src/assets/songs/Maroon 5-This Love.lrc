[00:03.00]
[00:20.46]I was so high 
[00:22.08]I did not recognize
[00:24.13]The fire burning in her eyes
[00:26.49]The chaos that controlled my mind
[00:28.79]
[00:30.79]Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
[00:34.38]Never to return again
[00:36.68]Always in my heart
[00:38.45]
[00:41.19]This love has taken it's toll on me
[00:45.72]She said Goodbye 
[00:47.89]Too many times before
[00:51.39]Her heart is breaking in front of me
[00:55.71]And I have no choice 
[00:58.07]'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[01:00.86]
[01:11.23]I tried my best to feed her appetite
[01:14.58]Keep her coming every night
[01:17.20]So hard to keep her satisfied
[01:19.12]
[01:21.30]Kept playing love like it was just a game

[02:03.99]Repair your broken wings
[02:06.66]And make sure everything's alright
[02:09.70](It's all right, It's all right)
[02:11.50]
[02:12.00]My pressure on your hips
[02:14.17]Sinking my fingertips
[02:16.61]Every inch of you
[02:18.49]Cause I know that's what you want me to do
[02:21.38]
