[00:17.49]Paint my face in your magazines 
[00:19.36]Make it look whiter than it seems 
[00:21.46]Paint me over with your dreams 
[00:23.49]Shove away my ethnicity 
[00:25.87]Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight 
[00:30.15]And say just what is on my mind 
[00:32.50]Without offending your might 
[00:34.43]
[00:34.71]Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
[00:42.90]But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
[00:51.90]So say what you want

[01:10.39]Now it's moccasins we sport 
[01:12.27]We take the culture and contort 
[01:14.54]Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding 
[01:17.92]
[01:18.94]Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
[01:27.17]But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
[01:36.07]But say what you want

[02:04.34]Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your 
[02:08.40]Broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo 
[02:11.42]Yeah, this life is too short to live it just for you 
[02:20.57]But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do

[02:47.01][02:29.70]Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you
