[00:00.21]There's clothes all over the floor.
[00:06.34]Don't remember them being here before.
[00:12.17]Smell of perfume isn't here.
[00:15.31]Why's lipstick on the mirror?
[00:18.33]And still I don't understand.
[00:23.70]
[00:24.46]No pictures left in the hall.
[00:30.33]It's plain there's holes in my wall.
[00:36.01]Where the hells my credit cards?
[00:39.60]Why the hells my wallet in the yard?
[00:42.60]And still I don't understand.
[00:47.09]
[00:48.20]Well now, I guess I should've listened.
[00:54.27]When you said you've had enough.
[00:59.90]A little trick I picked up from my father.
[01:03.59]in one ear and out the other.
[01:06.50]Why's love got to be so tuff?
[01:11.08]
[01:12.25]Should've seen the look on my face.
[01:17.92]My shits all over the place!
[01:23.71]Why's this happening to me?

[01:30.07]And still I don't understand.
