[00:20.00]I worry that I can't give you what you need
[00:27.00]that you'll find nothing underneath the peel
[00:35.00]that I can't undo the times we disagreed
[00:42.00]that I can't ignore the way I feel
[00:46.30]
[00:48.60]'cos what I feel is the only truth I know
[00:56.00]and I get by on this naivete of youth
[01:02.00]
[01:04.00]if what I feel is the only truth
[01:12.00]and what I give out will make up what I'll receive
[01:19.00]can I leave behind my naivety of youth?
[01:27.00]will I be crucified for wanting to believe?
[01:34.00]I believe
[01:38.00]
[01:44.00]could you hold us up if I would drag us down?
[01:51.00]resurrect emotions from our past
[01:59.00]n' if they had a king for fools
[02:01.00]would you wear the crown?

[02:28.00]if what I feel is the only truth
[02:35.00]and what I give out will make up what I'll receive
[02:43.00]can I still leave behind my naivety of youth?
[02:50.00]will I be crucified for wanting to believe?
[03:00.00]
[03:07.00]and if we don't worry about a thing
[03:11.00]will we be sorry when the rain is falling again
[03:15.00]and what does it matter
[03:17.00]if fortune should favor
[03:20.00]it's never the final amen
