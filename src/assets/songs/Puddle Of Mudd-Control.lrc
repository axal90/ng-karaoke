[00:23.49]I love the way you look at me
[00:26.02]I feel the pain you place inside
[00:28.70]lock me up inside ya dirty cage
[00:31.74]while I'm alone inside my mind

[01:10.01]I love the way you rape my skin
[01:12.63]I feel the hate you place inside
[01:15.26]I need to get your voice out of my head
[01:18.14]Cause I'm the guy you'll never find

[01:21.47]I think you know all the rules
[01:24.22]there's no expressions on your face
[01:26.64]I'm hoping some day you will let me go
[01:30.22]Release me from my dirty cage
