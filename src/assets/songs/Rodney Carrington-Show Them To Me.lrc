[00:12.24]Oh it seems to me
[00:14.67]This whole world's gone crazy
[00:18.40]And there's too much hate and killing going on
[00:23.63]But when I see the bare chest of a woman
[00:30.34]My worries and my problems are all gone
[00:36.26]No one thinks of fightin'
[00:38.93]When they see a topless girl
[00:42.22]Any maybe if you would show yours too
[00:45.58]We could save the world

[00:54.10]Show them to me
[00:56.97]Show them to me
[01:00.52]Unclasp your bra and set those puppies free
[01:05.31]They'd look a whole better without that sweater
[01:08.60]baby, I'm sure you'll agree
[01:11.47]If you got two fun bags
[01:14.58]Show them to me

[01:23.29]I don't care if they don't match
[01:25.22]Or one's bigger than the other
[01:28.27]You can show me one
[01:31.32]And I'll imagine the other
[01:34.11]Even if you're really old
[01:36.85]There's nothing wrong
[01:39.34]Don't be sad your boobs ain't bad
[01:41.58]They're just a little long

[01:43.57]Show them to me
[01:46.55]Show them to me
[01:49.71]Lift up your shirt and let the whole world see
[01:55.56]Just disrobe show your globes
[01:57.86]And a happy man I'll be
[02:00.79]If you got dos chi chi's
[02:04.34]Show them to me

[02:12.36]I've met a lot of them
[02:14.48]But never one I've hated
[02:17.41]Even if you've had thirteen kids
[02:19.64]And you think they look deflated
[02:22.94]There's no such thing as a bad breast
[02:25.49]I believe this much is true
[02:28.10]If your a big fat man I'm a titty fan
[02:30.59]And I'd love to see yours too
