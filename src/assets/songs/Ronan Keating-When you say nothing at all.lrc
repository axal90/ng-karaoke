[00:12.26]It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
[00:22.93]Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
[00:33.79]Try as I may I could never explain
[00:39.40]What I hear when you don't say a thing
[00:44.96]
[00:48.70]The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
[00:53.88]There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
[00:59.56]The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall
[01:10.98]You say it best
[01:14.16]When you say nothing at all
[01:18.39]
[01:27.64]All day long I can hear people talking out loud
[01:38.94]But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
[01:49.54]Try as they may they can never define
[01:55.41]What's been said between your heart and mine
