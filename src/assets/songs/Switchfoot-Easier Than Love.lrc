[00:18.92]She sells cars,
[00:20.80]She sells magazines
[00:23.50]Addictive bittersweet, clap your hands,
[00:27.84]with the hopeless nicotines

[01:08.95]What have we done?
[01:10.83]What is the monster we've become?

[01:45.73]Our banner waves with a neon glow
[01:49.01]War and love become pedantic,
[01:53.00]We wage love with a mistletoe
