[00:40.40]I packed my bags, moved out of town on my own again.
[00:49.19]I learn to live, live off this land by my feet.
[01:00.45]You were always on my mind,
[01:09.17]You were always on my mind, but that's just fine
[01:18.96]
[01:34.15]You know I travel far, growing my hair over all my eyes.
[01:42.47]I just pick my star, and start back again.
[01:50.59]But I don't know what to say, and I don't know what to do, without you.

[03:10.76](Always on my mind)
[03:16.63]
[03:16.81]You, always on my mind,
[03:18.72]Oh no that's just fine,
[03:22.66]Oh no that's just fine,
[03:26.30]Oh no that's just fine,
[03:29.32]Hey!
[03:30.77]Yeah yeah that's just fine!
