[00:19.61]The clock strikes past the hour.

[01:17.47]Are you hanging on for hope?
[01:21.15]It's all you've got worth living for.

[01:27.96]the road out?

[02:25.92]Do you feel the cold wind whisper?
[02:29.42]Is there anything...
[02:34.11]
[02:34.41]Do you ever cower 
[02:40.38]when the clock strikes every hour?
[02:43.75]Is there anything more deafening?
