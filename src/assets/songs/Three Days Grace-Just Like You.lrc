[00:09.30]

[00:12.30]I could be mean

[00:14.26]I could be angry

[00:18.13]You know I could be just like you

[00:20.28] 

[00:26.90]I could be fake

[00:29.57]I could be stupid

[00:32.80]You know I could be just like you

 

[00:35.71]You thought you were sitting beside me

[00:39.83]Your were only in my way

[01:06.78] 

[01:08.95]I could be cold

[01:11.32]I could be ruthless

[01:14.48]You know I could be just like you

[01:17.25] 

[01:19.22]I could be weak

[01:21.79]I could be senseless

[01:25.15]You know I could be just like you

[01:27.72] 

[01:29.49]You thought you were sitting beside me

[01:31.45]Your were only in my way

[01:36.25]You are wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

[01:37.99]

[01:59.76] 

[02:06.12]On my own, cause I can't take liven with you

[02:16.16]I'm alone, so I won't turn out like you

[02:20.86]Want me to
